            <h1>Summer Adventures &amp; Us!</h1>
            <p>This summer we explored four different cities:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <a href="#stl">St. Louis, MO</a></li>

         <h2>Santa Rosa, FL</h2>
         <img id="sr" src="/Users/katiegermano/lc101/html-me-something/images/santa rosa2.jpg"/>
         <p>The first city in our summer adventure is Santa Rosa, FL. We had seven days of white sandy beaches and sun. 
            We swam, collected sea shells, attempted to surf, and ate and drank a lot! It was a great start to the summer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <a name="door county"></a>
          <h2>Door County, WI</h2>
          <img id="dc" src="/Users/katiegermano/lc101/html-me-something/images/mapdoorcounty.gif" />
          <p>Door County is on the very tip of the peninsula between Green Bay
              and Lake Michigan in Wisconsin. Hiking, biking, boating and fishing are just a few
              of the activities available in this beautiful place. The weather is warm during the day and 
              cool enough in the evening for bonfires.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="kansascity">
          <a name="kc"></a>
          <h2>Kansas City, MO</h2>
          <img id="kcimg" src="/Users/katiegermano/lc101/html-me-something/images/kc.jpg" />
          <p>Kansas City is home away from home. Family and friend gatherings, along with Royals games are the 
              highlights of our summer trips to our first home. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <a name="stl"></a>
          <h2>St. Louis, MO</h2>
          <img src="/Users/katiegermano/lc101/html-me-something/images/gateway-arch-stlouis-night.jpg" />
          <p>And of course our final adventures were right here at home. From the Arch to the zoo to Grant's farm, we always have 
              Summer in St. Louis is our favorite season. We are always sad when the summer is over!</p>
